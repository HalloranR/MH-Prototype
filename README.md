This is the Prototype to Madness Hunters Pitch

Madness Hunters is a 2D top down "yank and slash" dungeon crawler. The main mechanic involves having two unmoving companions that are mapped to two of the face buttons on a standard game pad. When the player presses one of those buttons and the trigger, the character that face button is assigned to gets pulled towards the player. These static companions do different things depending on whether they are being pulled or not. For example, the gun wielding companionâ€™s rate of fire increases when being pulled by the player. This game was presented in front of a panel of game industry experts who ultimately decided that our game should be cut. I am of the opinion that there is depth in this control scheme and while I understand their concerns about our muddled direction,  I believe that we would have made a fantastic and unique game with this concept
